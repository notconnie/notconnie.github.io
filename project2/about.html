            <h1>The Farm</h1> 
            <br>
                <p>We are young farmers in collective. Proud member and co-founder of the Raceme Farm Collective. We farm with Scrapberry Farm and Sun Moon Fields, and are in community with farmers at Black Futures Farm and Unity Farm.</p><br>

                <p>You can find our products at the <a href="https://www.comethrupdx.org/">Come Thru PDX Market</a> every other Monday at the Redd East, occasionally at the <a href="https://www.montavillamarket.org/">Montavilla Farmers Market</a> on the 4th Sunday, at <a href="https://seagrapeapothecary.com/">Seagrape Apothecary</a> and at <a href="https://www.lunaspapdx.com/">Luna Wellness PDX</a>. We are always at the Come Thru PDX Market every 1st and 3rd Monday, May–October.</p><br>

                <p>Our mircro-farm, where we grow herbs, raise rabbits for meat and hens for egg production, is located in what is known as Portland. (As well as scattered sites in Portland.)</p> 
                <p>We use a combination of conventional and traditional indigenous farm practices. We never use chemical pesticides or other chemically based methods for our growing. We grow seed-to-finish:  Herbs, Produce, and Flowers.</p><br>
                <p>
                In addition to farming small livestock and herbs, we also teach backyard chicken and rabbit raising, dispatching classes, and garden design consultation. We are also available for tailored classes and one-on-one consultations</p><br>
