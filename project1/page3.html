                <h3>Nerdin Out On Hand Saws</h3>

<p>Just for fun, take a Western tenon saw and a piece of wood and try to cut a joint.  You can't use any work-holding beyond your own body.  How did that work out?  I imagine you didn't get very far, and I wouldn't either because these tools can't be used alone.  A tenon saw needs a bench, a vice, a hold fast, or a bench-hook.  The work must be held steady and it must resist the pushing force of the tool.  Without appropriate work-holding, the tool is useless.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Japanese work-holding is more subtle and relies more on the body, but it's just as present.  The planing beam and planning board have built-in stops to resist the pulling force of saws and planes.  The Japanese carpenter might throw a foot or a knee over the work, but every move he or she makes with a tool can be braced to stay steady.

<br><br>When you bring the Japanese tool into the Western shop, things get a bit dicey.  Japanese saws work well with a vise.  The Dozuki, in particular, cuts lovely dovetails and isn't much different from a Western backsaw.  But with other Japanese saws, your bench-hooks are facing the wrong way.  You'll need to make new ones, or hook them over the far side of your bench.  You might have to lean at an uncomfortable angle.  Your saw-bench might work well with a Ryoba, or you might find it awkward and build a pair of low Japanese horses.  Many Western craftsman use nothing but Japanese saws and achieve excellent results, but there is some cobbling-together of jigs and fixtures for holding stock.
<br><br>
The truth is all tools exist in a system.  No plane or saw works on its own.  They all require appropriate work-holding and each woodworking tradition gives us all the solutions we need for the pieces we might want to build.  I honestly get a little irritated when people ask me if Japanese saws are better.  The question isn't which tool is better; the question is, what do you want to build?
<br><br>
Consider the green-wood chair-maker.  He or she needs to split wood, rive it into sections, carve it, turn it, and mortise it.  For these operations, the chair-maker has the block, the shave-horse, the lathe, the riving break and perhaps a knee-height bench.  No other fixtures are necessary.  A traditional chair-maker might not even own a plane, so the question of Japanese or Western makes no sense.
<br><br>
Every woodworking tradition is optimized for the objects it produces.  It's when we cross traditions that challenges crop up.  Ask a Shaker cabinet-maker to produce a Japanese Shoji screen and the results would probably be disappointing.  Ask a Japanese shokunin to build a Windsor chair and the results would beâ€¦honestly, I have no idea how that would work out.</p>
